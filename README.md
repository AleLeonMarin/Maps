# Map Navigation System

## Overview

**Map Navigation System** is my first project designed for an intuitive and efficient map-based navigation system. It utilizes advanced data structures to implement pathfinding algorithms like Floyd-Warshall and Dijkstra, ensuring accurate and optimal route calculations. The system features a user-friendly interface that provides detailed summaries of routes, the ability to pause ongoing navigation, and the flexibility to redirect between different points (A to B) during route execution.

## Features

- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implements Floyd-Warshall and Dijkstra algorithms for efficient route calculations.
- **Dynamic Route Management**: Allows users to pause navigation and redirect routes between different points in real-time.
- **Comprehensive Route Summaries**: Provides detailed information, including distance, estimated time, and waypoints.
- **Interactive Interface**: Designed for ease of use, with clear visuals and intuitive controls for selecting points and visualizing routes.
- **Live Updates**: Adapts to changes in navigation instantly, recalculating routes as needed.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes a modern and reliable tech stack:

- **Java 21**: Core programming language.
- **JavaFX 21**: For an intuitive and interactive graphical user interface.
- **Data Structures**: Graph-based implementations to support advanced pathfinding algorithms.
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and IntelliJ IDEA.

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run **Map Navigation System**, follow these steps:

1. **Install Java JDK 21**: Ensure that JDK 21 is installed and properly configured on your system.

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Build the project and package it as a JAR file.
   - Execute the JAR file to launch the application.
